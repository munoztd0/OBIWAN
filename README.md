Folders are organised in BIDS format (see in each folder for further info)


Please note that not these scripts have been modified for reproducibility purpose (e.g. code flexibility) and are then not exactly the same used by us. The scripts should work as it is but some of them might need to be adapted.

Codes and data from the REWOD project
David Mu√±oz Tord

This folder contains all codes and data necessary to reproduce the behavioral and MRI analyses

Please note that the codes needs: 

Matlab R2014b or a more resent version, with SPM8 or above

FSL 3.3.0 or a more resent version

ANTs 2.1.0 or a more resent version

Python 2.7 (and python 3.5 or above for the BIDS)

R 3.1.1 or a more resent version


Please get in touch with your experiences with using the codes and data, and any bug reports or issues to me at david.munoz@etu.unige.ch
