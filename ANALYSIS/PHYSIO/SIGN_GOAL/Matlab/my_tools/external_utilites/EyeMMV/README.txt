EyeMMV toolbox (Eye Movements Metrics & Visualizations) is a MATLAB toolbox appropriate for post experimental eye movement analysis. 

EyeMMV toolbox consists of seven main functions (fixation_detection.m, metrics_analysis.m, visualizations.m, visualizations_stimulus.m, heatmap_generator.m, ROI_analysis.m, angle_to_tracker.m).

The folder demo_data consists of eye tracking demo data and fixations, a demo stimulus, file with demo ROIs and instructions (file "call_functions_with_demo_data.txt") which can help you to execute EyeMMV's functions.
