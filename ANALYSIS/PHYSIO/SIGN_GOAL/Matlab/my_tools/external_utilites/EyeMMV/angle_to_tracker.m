%function angle_to_tracker
%compute distance t in stimuli display from visual range in tracker units
%input parameters:
%-theta: visual angle range in degrees
%-d: distance between subject and stimulus in mm
%-tmm: the distance in mm which corresponds with 1 unit in tracker values
%export matlab matrix:
%-t:the corresponded spatial section in tracker units
%call function example:
%angle_to_tracker(8,555,301.1)
function t=angle_to_tracker(theta,d,tmm)
%transform angle from degrees to rads
theta=theta*pi()/180;
%compute t
t=(2*d/tmm)*tan(theta/2); %tracker units
